<h1 class="border border-muted">This is the story of Kole Kendrick</h1>
<p>Kazakhstan: April 19 2003</p>
<p>From birth Viktor was placed in an orphanage. For the next three years Viktor would be learning the basics of life, like using the 'potty'.
    In 2006 Viktor, was adopted by Pete and Susie Kendrick. Soon after, Viktor was given the name "Kole" as his official middle name by his two siblings:
    Keegan and Kelsey Kendrick. When coming up with the name, the two siblings wanted it to start with a "k" because both of their names began with a "k".
    From this point on Viktor's name was officially Viktor Kole Kendrick.</p>
<p>Danville KY: 2006</p>
<p>After arriving in the United States, Kole was very tired, so as he slept, his parents decided to introduce him to all their friends and family. For the next 5 years, Kole lived on a farm
    with a huge pool, and nice house. He played a lot with his siblings in the pool, even when his older sister was being annoying. One day when getting ready for church with his mom, he asked if he could go to the later service with his dad, and she agreed. While waiting on his dad to wake up, Kole went downstairs
    to play video games on his brother's Xbox 360. When his dad did wake up, he was unaware of needing to take Kole to church that morning. While playing games, Kole heard the front door open and shut and went to go see what was happening.
    His father had left him at the house by himself unintentionally. Was Kole worried? or scared to be home alone? no. After playing some more video games, Kole began to get a bit hungry, so he went back upstairs to fetch him something to eat.
    When his parents came home, they ran inside because they both realized Kole was left alone at the house. When they arrived, they found him eating Bologna and Poptarts. </p>
